Create an HTML page that contains a text area 
and a button labeled Create.
When the user enters in text into the text 
area and then clicks the create button, 
create a new card element in the DOM. You 
decide the height/width of the card.
When the user clicks the Delete button, 
the containing card, and no other cards, 
should then be removed from the DOM. Not 
just made invisible, actually removed from 
the DOM.
//need a delete button within the card
//card has to be a class because there will be more than one
var createButton = document.getElementById("create");
var deleteButton = document.getElementById("delete");
//it will be a dynamic delete
var input = document.getElementsByClassName("inputArea");
//card will also be dynamic, created only  after a button is clicked

var container = document.getElementById();
var card = document.getElementsbyClassName("cardDiv");
